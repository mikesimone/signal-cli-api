# signal-cli-api

A native REST + WebSocket API for [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli). Build Signal bots, notification systems, and integrations in any language.

## Why this one

- **Zero config.** Run `signal-cli-api` and it works. Auto-spawns signal-cli, picks free ports, no containers or orchestration needed.
- **Real-time streaming.** WebSocket, SSE, and webhook delivery for incoming messages. No polling loops.
- **Observable.** Prometheus metrics, structured request tracing with `x-request-id`, per-RPC latency logging.
- **Native TLS.** Pass `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key`. No reverse proxy needed for HTTPS.
- **Fast.** Rust + axum. Sub-millisecond request overhead. Persistent JSON-RPC connection to signal-cli (no JVM restarts per request).
- **Tested.** 267 integration tests against a mock signal-cli daemon.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
cargo install signal-cli-api
```

### 2. Set up signal-cli and link your phone

```bash
brew install signal-cli          # or your package manager
brew install qrencode            # to display QR code in terminal
```

Link signal-cli to your existing Signal account (keeps your phone working):

```bash
signal-cli link -n "my-server" | tee >(xargs -L 1 qrencode -t utf8)
```

This prints a QR code in your terminal. Scan it with your phone:
**Signal app > Settings > Linked Devices > Link New Device**.

Wait for the process to exit — linking is complete. Then sync your contacts:

```bash
signal-cli -u +1234567890 receive
```

### 3. Run

```bash
signal-cli-api
```

That's it. API is live at `http://localhost:8080`. signal-cli is managed automatically.

If you already run signal-cli as a daemon:

```bash
signal-cli-api --signal-cli 127.0.0.1:7583
```

### Options

```
--signal-cli <addr>   Connect to existing signal-cli daemon (default: auto-spawn)
--listen <addr>       HTTP listen address (default: 127.0.0.1:8080, falls back to random port if busy)
--tls-cert <path>     TLS certificate (PEM). Enables HTTPS.
--tls-key <path>      TLS private key (PEM). Required with --tls-cert.
```

## Send a message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v2/send \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello from my app!",
    "number": "+1234567890",
    "recipients": ["+1987654321"]
  }'
```

```json
{"timestamp": 1234567890}
```

### The `send` contract: raw passthrough by design

`/v1/send` and `/v2/send` are a **deliberate, undocumented-field-friendly
passthrough** to signal-cli's `send` JSON-RPC method — the request body is
forwarded to signal-cli almost verbatim (see "Attachments" below for the one
exception), with no field whitelist. This is a decided design choice, not an
oversight: it's what lets every signal-cli `send` capability work here
immediately, including ones this README doesn't spell out, without waiting
on a matching typed field to be added to this project first.

Field names match signal-cli's own JSON-RPC parameter names (the same names
you'd use with `signal-cli --output=json jsonRpc`), **not** a REST-ified
alias set — with one built-in convenience: `recipients` (plural) is accepted
as an alias for `recipient`, courtesy of signal-cli's own JSON-RPC parameter
binding (it falls back from a missing `recipient` key to `recipients`). No
other pluralized/renamed alias is supported. In particular:

- `account` is required (not `number`) — signal-cli only resolves the
  sending account from a top-level `account` field. On a daemon with more
  than one registered account (this deployment has two), a `number` field
  is silently ignored and the call fails with "Method requires valid
  account parameter."
- `attachment` is the real field for attachments (not `base64_attachments`),
  and takes an array of either data URIs
  (`data:<mime>;filename=<name>;base64,<data>`) or file paths already on the
  signal-cli host.

Commonly-used fields beyond the basics, confirmed to work purely because the
passthrough has no whitelist:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `editTimestamp` | number | Edit a previously-sent message in place |
| `quoteTimestamp` / `quoteAuthor` / `quoteMessage` | number / string / string | Quote a prior message |
| `storyTimestamp` / `storyAuthor` | number / string | Reply to a story |
| `mention` | array of `"start:length:recipient"` strings | @-mention a group member |
| `textStyle` | array of `"start:length:STYLE"` strings | Bold/italic/strikethrough/spoiler/monospace spans |
| `noUrgent` | bool | Suppress the push notification (still delivered in real time if the app is open) |
| `viewOnce` | bool | Send as a view-once message |
| `sticker` | `"packId:stickerId"` string | Send a sticker |
| `previewUrl` / `previewTitle` / `previewDescription` / `previewImage` | strings | Attach a link preview |
| `voiceNote` | bool | Mark an audio attachment as a voice note |
| `groupId` | string | Send to a group instead of `recipient` |
| `noteToSelf` | bool | Send to your own account |

This isn't an exhaustive list — any parameter signal-cli's `send` JSON-RPC
method accepts works, whether or not it's named above. See
[`SendCommand.java`](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/blob/master/src/main/java/org/asamk/signal/commands/SendCommand.java)
in signal-cli for the canonical, versioned source of truth. If a future
refactor ever replaces this passthrough with a typed request struct, every
field in this table (plus `account`/`recipient`/`message`/`attachment`) must
keep working, or it's a breaking change for production callers depending on
it today.

## Receive messages

### WebSocket (recommended for bots)

Connect to `ws://localhost:8080/v1/receive/+1234567890`. Messages stream as JSON:

```json
{
  "envelope": {
    "source": "+1987654321",
    "dataMessage": {
      "message": "Hey!",
      "timestamp": 1234567890
    }
  }
}
```

Works with any WebSocket client — Python, Node, Go, Rust, whatever.

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8080/v1/events/+1234567890
```

### Webhooks

Push incoming messages to your HTTP endpoint:

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/webhooks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-app.com/signal-hook"}'

# With event filtering
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/webhooks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-app.com/hook", "events": ["message", "receipt"]}'
```

## Monitoring

Prometheus-compatible metrics at `/metrics`:

```
signal_messages_sent_total 42
signal_messages_received_total 108
signal_rpc_calls_total 312
signal_rpc_errors_total 0
signal_ws_clients_active 2
```

Every request gets an `x-request-id` header and structured log entry:

```
INFO request_id=47 method=POST path="/v2/send" status=201 latency_ms=1152
INFO rpc_method="send" status=201 latency_ms=1150
```

are real signal-cli JSON-RPC methods (`getConfiguration`/`setConfiguration`
only exist on signal-cli's D-Bus interface; the account-settings pair don't
exist anywhere in signal-cli). See `src/routes/config.rs` for the full
explanation and what real signal-cli capability (`updateConfiguration`) this
would need to be rebuilt around.
